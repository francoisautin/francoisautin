# Introduction

Hi :wave: My name is Fran√ßois Autin and I am currently studying Software Engineering.

## Prior experience

I started off developing small dynamic websites using PHP. My most prized achievement to date is [https://globtopus.fr/](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317094849/http://www.globtopus.fr/) (archive link). The website sported a feature complete blogging system built by hand. However I can not guarantee that security was strongly considered during development :sweat_smile:

## Studies

During my bachelor's degree, I was introduced to **Java** (still my main language to this day), **Scala**, **Python** and **C**. I've thus dabbled in OOP, procedural programming and functional programming. I also have experience in UI design using JavaFX.

### Internship

I am currently an intern in a software development company based in France. The project I am working on involves scripting in bash, using Springboot to build a REST API on the MVC model, Typescript and Vue.js in order to build the front-end and CI/CD proficiency.
